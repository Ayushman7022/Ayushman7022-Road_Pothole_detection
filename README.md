🚧 Pothole Detection System (Deep Learning + Computer Vision)

A complete end-to-end system that detects potholes from images or live video feed using a trained deep learning model. This project aims to assist municipal bodies and smart-city systems by automating road-condition monitoring.

📌 Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) / YOLO / custom model (your choice) to detect potholes in real-time or from uploaded images.

✔️ Image-based detection
✔️ Real-time video detection (webcam / mobile)
✔️ Preprocessing & augmentation
✔️ Model training + evaluation
✔️ Easy deployment with Python/Colab
